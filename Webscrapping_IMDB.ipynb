The only thing that I would say they did wrong was not enough fighting and action. There was so much depth to this character and is perfect if you are in love with the marvel universe. If you are just a person who likes action a ton, this movie may not be for you but if you admire the way marvel is becoming, you will love this movie. Don't watch this movie with a negative attitude towards it. Give it a chance and you will be surprised!\n",

Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.\n",

            "3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.\n",

            "1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; \"but you didnt deserve that yet...\" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way)\n",
            "\n",
            "3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.\n",
            "\n",
            "so that's why i gave it a 7. it's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers(hihihi geeks out). Go see it. it is nowhere near as bad as iron man 2/thor 2, but it doesn't touch civil war, infinity war etc. either, its like rifght in the middle. inbetween those 20+ films.\n",

So I Googled further to see what she said, she came across arrogant in them and a smidge out of touch but none of it explained the overwhelming hate I've seen aimed at her. Then I remembered that people talk about all the different types of bigotry but misogyny rarely comes up, I remembered that it's visibly increased over the past decade and appreciated why she's been targeted. News flash, the outspoken loud brash man hating femnists you likely thing of when you hear that word make up a very small percentage.

            "This movie feels out of place in the MCU, it feels Fury is not the same character we meet (only) 10 years later. The movie tries to force us to like Brie Larson, not Carol Danvers or Captain Marvel. The character feels like a mix between Tony Stark, Thor and Feminist Captain America. To make things worse, at the end she is way to OP. However, the movie had some good jokes, it was not over preachy. Sure there where some Cringe moments, but all in all it could be worse. The best part of this movie is the 90's nostalgia, Ben Medelsohn, Fury&Goose and The Kree. BUT the Kree do not get that much screen time, they feel like The Warriors 3 with even less to do. The intro does gave me shivers, what a tribute to Stan Lee. I would say Captain Marvel is Solo: A Star Wars Story mixed with The Incredible Hulk, a fun popcorn movie but nothing more.\n",

I thought it was a fun, almost lighthearted origin movie - I feel like people were so wrapped up in the angsty mindset from Infinity War that they took this one too seriously. I thoroughly enjoyed this as a superhero movie and the humour did not miss the mark in my cinema.\n",

            "I believe Screen Junkies put it best, this is a Phase One Movie in a Phase Three world. This is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless. Where the Russo's, Waititi, Gunn, Coogler, and even Reed (Among Others) shined Fleck and Boden's direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another Marvel outing. However it's not without it's charm. The visuals are stellar to look at, and the makeup on the fan-favorite Skrulls is a sight for sore eyes. The performances by Jackson and Mendelssohn are fantastic, but the movie wouldn't be anything without its leading lady. Brie Larson turns is a fine performance and it's great to see this character finally integrated into the MCU, however she's given very little to work with, and there's not much that truly distinguishes her yet, that's not the fault of Larson, just a writing and direction problem. The film is a fine spectacle, and a nice solo venture, but there's just not much originality that we've seen with the past slate of Marvel films.\n",

            "I respect the different opinions, but I don't agree when people say that the movie sucks, Larson's actong is horrible and it's a weak movie. I just cannot agree! Capitain Marvel is fantastic!! Brie Larson does a nice job playing as Carol Danvers, Sam Jackson also does very well playing as a younger Nick Fury and I really enjoyed the Skrull leader Talos. Also, the visual effects are incredible and the action scenes are really nice. I just don't give a ten because I believe the action scenes could have been more exciting, like in Infinity War, but it was good enough for me. Resuming: Capitain Marvel is an action-packed movie that may not be as epic as IW and Civil War, but it holds your attention the full time and introduces the most powerful character in the MCU, who is gonna kick Thanos's ass in Avengers: Endgame! Obs: watch the two post- credits scenes. Both will be important to understand some hints about Endgame.\n",

Now I can't really get a definitive answer. From what I see it's a combination of people not liking her attitude and her comments on feminism. So I Googled further to see what she said, she came across arrogant in them and a smidge out of touch but none of it explained the overwhelming hate I've seen aimed at her. Then I remembered that people talk about all the different types of bigotry but misogyny rarely comes up, I remembered that it's visibly increased over the past decade and appreciated why she's been targeted. News flash, the outspoken loud brash man hating femnists you likely thing of when you hear that word make up a very small percentage. Feminism is good, if you disagree I hope you simply don't know the meaning of the word.\",\n",

It is so good. It is the perfect movie for introducing this character and they did so many things right. The only thing that I would say they did wrong was not enough fighting and action. There was so much depth to this character and is perfect if you are in love with the marvel universe. If you are just a person who likes action a ton, this movie may not be for you but if you admire the way marvel is becoming, you will love this movie. Don't watch this movie with a negative attitude towards it. Give it a chance and you will be surprised!\",\n          \"First starts of with showing the story of her, she unravels her life and she is extremely talented. But the story and everything made it even better. Mimics, humor and the chemistry between actors, all were amazing.
